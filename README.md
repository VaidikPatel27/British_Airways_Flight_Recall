### Introduction

British Airways (BA), the national airline of the United Kingdom (UK), operates numerous flights daily, facilitating travel for passengers worldwide. Whether individuals are embarking on vacations, business trips, or other endeavors, the intricate process of managing flight schedules, planning, boarding, fueling, transportation, and ensuring punctuality while upholding exceptional customer service entails significant responsibility.

As a data scientist within BA, your role involves leveraging analytical expertise to inform substantial real-world decisions from the outset. Your contributions will directly impact the organization by guiding critical business strategies, optimizing operational costs, and driving revenue growth through the implementation of your recommendations, tools, and models.

Throughout their journey with BA, customers engage with various touchpoints of the brand. Consequently, comprehending customers' sentiments, preferences, and feedback remains paramount for any business, including BA.

Customers wield more influence than ever before, empowered by instant access to a vast array of information. This shift in dynamics has significantly altered the traditional buying cycle. In today's landscape, the notion of expecting customers to make purchasing decisions upon arrival at the airport is obsolete; such a reactive approach is no longer viable. Airlines must instead adopt a proactive stance, engaging customers well before they embark on their holiday journeys.

This proactive engagement is made possible through the utilization of data and predictive models. The crux of an effective predictive model lies in the quality of the data used to train machine learning algorithms. Therefore, your task entails the manipulation and preparation of the provided customer booking data to ensure the development of a high-caliber predictive model.

Once the predictive model is constructed, it is imperative to interpret its results thoroughly. This involves gauging the model's predictive efficacy and determining its suitability for forecasting the target outcome, i.e., customers purchasing holidays. Consequently, you must assess the model's performance and elucidate the contribution of each variable towards enhancing the predictive power of the mod

### Data
From Forage Education, I got an opportunity to work on a interesting project. In this project I need to scrap data from a specific website
(https://www.airlinequality.com/airline-reviews/british-airways).
I got scrapped data like customer name, review, ratings given by customer, is service recommendable to others or not and other information too.
From this kind of information I need to first do EDA and than create a model that can predict that this customer will revisit British Airways service again or not.
